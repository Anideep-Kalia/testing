Cypress

- yarn run cypress open

- cypress folder -> integration -> delete all and write your own file

- support -> command.js -> delete all content and write what's in other file

- add chrome extension for getting element/query name "testing playground" you can see in the inspect
-----------------------------------------


- In playground we can see the identifier to test the e2e test by clicking on the laser-sight and then you search in the vscode tab to locate the element

- uuidv4 is just there to fill random information

- we need scrollIntoView() as sometimes cyperus unable to find the element to test as the element is hidden so it scrolls so that it could find the element

- but sometime it is in view but then also it shows error so to deal with that we we "force:true"
